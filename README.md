Some  popular brotherly examples to this technology are distributed source code mangement technologies like Git, SVN.

## Where it all begins !:
Data integrity comes from Hashing techniques, where a hashfunction taking any amount of data to produce a ":smirk: collision resistant hash value :smirk:".

Public Key Infrastructure, too much a name for a  set of keys, conjoined by cryptographic destiny, that endorse another set of keys, with a dispute of "Who the hell are you to endorse in the first place?", which is often helplessly depended upon for bet against the endorsers reputation, "so no legal drags works here!".

## A rather Block*buster* Chain not litereally.


## Operating Models
### Pure Distributed Model
It carries the pure essence of distributed nature for the common data between the participants using blockchain technology. 

#### One Authority with Interested Participants
An authority with only as much authority and control required to create and maintain the some kind of blockchain network infrastructure between the interested participants.

Many Software Companies from Huge infrastructure behemoths to Application Service solution providers,and the most promising ones - newbies in startups, can pull themselves into the happening times of the Blockchain technology.

##### Infrastructure behemoths or Tech Giants

###### IBM with the first come and having the first serve.
IBM as _you name it we have it_ provider started out into the blocktchain technology with cloud based hosting platform to blockchain network with a beloved name ***fabric***, reintroducing the blockchain technolgy as a hyperledger with potential implications to a ledger of recorded transactions with opening the applications possiblity on various markets like Procurement, Asset Management e.t.c 

##### Group of Rebels having their own covert operations
Any group of individuals can come together and make their own network, from as much vanila to  much complicated implementation by atleast following the basic blockchain technology principles.

### IBM Business Block
