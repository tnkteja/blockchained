Some  popular brotherly examples to this technology are distributed source code mangement technologies like Git, SVN.

## Where it all begins !:
Data integrity comes from Hashing techniques, where a hashfunction taking any amount of data to produce a ":smirk: collision resistant hash value :smirk:".

Public Key Infrastructure, too much a name for a  set of keys, conjoined by cryptographic destiny, that endorse another set of keys, with a dispute of "Who the hell are you to endorse in the first place?", which is often helplessly depended upon for bet against the endorsers reputation, "so no legal drags works here!".

Ordering of facts with consensus is computer science problem, not really, it is a computer networks problem, two machines contending for 
its next turn on the shared medium, we call it every other nanosecond ***da!!***. 

Integrity of facts with consensus is another problem
, a rather hilariously doomed to sink solution for it is Proof of Work, which is hash value for the participants `new fact on the block + previous block hash value on the block emphasizing chainess + bruteforcely sweated value`, hard to generate, but easy to validate by the depending participant, generated fully or partly by the so called ***Miners***, to emphasize that ***finders are keepers***, who get some credit value possibly as a some reward, or infamously bitcoins way as transaction with a new block on top of the block they mined, with sudden realisation of involved inflation, where miner again needs other miner to establish consensus on his work, which only resulting in exponential expenditure of computational power raising the value of credit earned. ***Huf!!!*** A genius wealthy man at the brink of his edge of goodness, becomes a miner, not just **Monopoly** problem,but  would scare the decade old vested interest in the bitcoin, with a two mining a new block with to achieve hash collisions, with immediete **trolling** of the depending participant. I will not even start about the practical problems. Until the Miner is done with his job, the dependent participant has to hold on to his fact on the block tight. :grimacing: ***Bam!!!***. from Eavesdroppers **racing to create hashcollisions** to create hashcollision. feeling a **Heart attack situation** where after gettting the block from the miner only to see irrepairnly altered facts on the block, putting the depending participant thorough the pain to seeking an even more stronger hash solution.


Proof of stake looked like a saviour but not for a while .

A Well orchestrated Smart fact on the block is which can implicate different intrepretations on the other facts participates addes to the new block. Say its a code, then

Consensus Service 

## A rather Block*buster* Chain not litereally.

Each Participant gets his own copy of the block chain. So no complaints.

## Classic
It carries the pure essence of distributed nature for the common data between the participants using blockchain technology. 

#### One Authority with Interested Participants
An authority with only as much authority and control required to create and maintain the some kind of blockchain network infrastructure between the interested participants.

Many Software Companies from Huge infrastructure behemoths to Application Service solution providers,and the most promising ones - newbies in startups, can pull themselves into the happening times of the Blockchain technology.

##### Infrastructure behemoths or Tech Giants

###### IBM with the first come and having the first serve.
IBM as _you name it we have it_ provider started out into the blocktchain technology with cloud based hosting platform to blockchain network with a beloved name ***fabric***, reintroducing the blockchain technolgy as a hyperledger with potential implications to a ledger of recorded transactions with opening the applications possiblity on various markets like Procurement, Asset Management e.t.c 

##### Group of Rebels having their own covert operations
Any group of individuals can come together and make their own network, from as much vanila to  much complicated implementation by atleast following the basic blockchain technology principles.

### IBM Business Block

Yearning Semantics: 

Monopoly Problem, Tragedy of commons
Double spend problem - Racee attack, Finney attack, Vector76 attack, Brute force attack, >50% attack.
